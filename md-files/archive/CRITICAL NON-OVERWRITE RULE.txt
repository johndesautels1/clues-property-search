 CRITICAL NON-OVERWRITE RULE
NEVER overwrite any existing field that has:

Confidence level: High, Medium-High, or Medium
A valid source citation
Unless: A higher-priority source with a newer date definitively supersedes it

ONLY fill or update:

Empty fields
Fields marked "Not Available"
Fields with "Low" confidence
Fields with outdated sources (when you have newer authoritative data)

When updating, always note: "Updated from [old source] to [new source] - [reason]"
