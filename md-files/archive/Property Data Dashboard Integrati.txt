# Property Data Dashboard Integration Brief

## Context
John E. Desautels & Associates is building a real estate intelligence dashboard as part of the CLUES™ (Comprehensive Location Utility & Evaluation System) platform launching Jan 1, 2026.

## Your Mission
Build the backend integration and frontend dashboard page that:
1. Accepts up to 10 property addresses from users
2. Sends those addresses to multiple LLMs via API webhook (or CSV fallback)
3. Receives back completed 110-field property data tables
4. Merges results from multiple LLMs without overwriting high-confidence fields
5. Displays the consolidated property profiles in a clean, scannable dashboard UI

## Critical Requirements
- **Never overwrite Medium/High confidence fields** unless newer authoritative source
- **Merge data from multiple LLMs** intelligently (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, Gemini, Grok, GPT-4o)
- **Track data provenance** (which LLM filled which field, when, from what source)
- **Handle conflicts gracefully** (show both values with sources when LLMs disagree)
- **Backend code: Claude Sonnet 4.5** (you're writing the integration layer)
- **Database: Link to existing CLUES Quantum Master App** (20-module system)

## Data Contract
- Each property has exactly 110 fields
- Each field has 4 attributes: `value`, `confidence`, `notes`, `sources`
- Confidence levels: High, Medium-High, Medium, Low
- Input: Up to 10 normalized addresses
- Output: JSON or CSV with all 110 fields per address

## Key Files Provided
1. `MASTER_PROTOCOL.md` - Complete instructions for LLMs on data collection
2. `SCHEMA_110_FIELDS.json` - Field definitions, data types, validation rules
3. `CSV_TEMPLATE.csv` - Blank template for CSV fallback mode
4. `API_SPEC.yaml` - OpenAPI specification for webhook endpoints

## Success Criteria
- User uploads 10 addresses → Dashboard shows 110-field profiles for all 10
- High completion rate (90%+ fields filled with Medium+ confidence)
- No data loss during LLM merges
- Clean, professional UI that John can demo to clients
- Seamless integration with existing CLUES database

## John's Priority
**100% truthfulness** - No placeholder data, no fabrication. If data isn't available, mark it clearly and suggest next steps.
